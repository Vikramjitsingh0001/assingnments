“Atticus said to Jem one day, “I’d rather you shot at tin cans in the backyard, but I know you’ll go after birds.
please kill the man kill him with kife just kill
Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.”

That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it.
